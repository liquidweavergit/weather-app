## Security Implementation

### Pinned Action Versions
- All GitHub Actions use **specific version tags** (not @main or @master)
- Security-focused action selection
- Regular updates through dependency monitoring

### Minimal Permissions
- **Least privilege principle** applied to all workflows
- Specific permissions for each job type
- Secure secret handling

### Vulnerability Scanning
- **Multi-layer security scanning**:
  - Dependency vulnerabilities (Safety, pip-audit)
  - Container vulnerabilities (Trivy)
  - Code security (Bandit, Semgrep)
  - License compliance

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **Docker layer caching** with GitHub Actions cache
- **Python dependency caching** with pip cache
- **Pre-commit hooks caching** for faster execution
- **Multi-level caching** (local + remote)

### Resource Optimization
- **Appropriate timeouts** for each job type
- **Efficient artifact management** with retention policies
- **Conditional job execution** to save resources

## Docker Integration

### Multi-Stage Builds
- **Development and production targets** supported
- **Build validation** for both stages
